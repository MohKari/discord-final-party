# Discord-Final-Party

## What Is This?

This is a simple integration between a discord server and a Trello board.
- Discord is used to issue commands to Trello

## Set-Up

Make a copy of the sample .env file...
```cp .env.sample .env` to duplicate .env file and fill out.```

## New Command

To add a new command, duplicate DemoCommand.php, and alter to need.
You will also need to add new command to Commands::$commands
